Object Orientated Programming -  GMIT module
The Caesar Cipher was created in Java! This cipher text in which each 
letter in the text is replaced by a letter with fixed number of positions 
down the alphabet. For example, with a left shift of 6, G would be replaced by D,
H would become E, and so on. You can encrypt as well as decrypt text using this format.
